# Go Development Guidelines

## Architecture Patterns

### Clean Architecture
This project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer** (`internal/domain/`): Pure business logic, entities, and interfaces
- **Application Layer** (`internal/application/`): Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`internal/infrastructure/`): External concerns (DB, HTTP, config)
- **Presentation Layer** (`internal/presentation/`): Web handlers and API endpoints

### Dependency Injection
Uses Uber FX for dependency injection. See [main.go](mdc:main.go) for the main application setup.

## Code Organization

### File Structure
- Use snake_case for file names
- Group related functionality in packages
- Keep packages focused and cohesive
- Use `internal/` for private application code

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for exported types and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that explain intent

### Error Handling
- Always check errors and handle them appropriately
- Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb for error wrapping
- Return errors from functions, don't panic in production code
- Use custom error types for domain-specific errors

## Testing

### Test Structure
- Tests are in `*_test.go` files alongside the code they test
- Use [testify](mdc:https:/github.com/stretchr/testify) for assertions
- Mock implementations are generated in [test/mocks/](mdc:test/mocks)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases

### Mock Generation
Run `task generate:mocks` to generate mocks for interfaces:
```go
//go:generate mockgen -source=repository.go -destination=test/mocks/mock_repository.go
```

## Database

### Migrations
- Database migrations are in [migrations/](mdc:migrations)
- Use `task migrate:up` to apply migrations
- Use `task migrate:down` to rollback migrations
- Always test migrations in development before production

### Repository Pattern
- Use repository interfaces in domain layer
- Implement repositories in infrastructure layer
- Use transactions for multi-step operations

## Logging

### Structured Logging
- Use Zap logger for structured logging
- Include relevant context in log fields
- Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Don't log sensitive information

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate configuration on startup
- Use sensible defaults where appropriate
- Document all configuration options

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
- Use HTTP status codes correctly
- Return consistent JSON responses
- Validate input data
- Handle errors gracefully

### Middleware
- Use Echo middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement authentication, logging, CORS, etc.
- Keep middleware focused and composable

## Code Quality

### Linting
- Run `task lint:backend` to check code quality
- Follow Go best practices and idioms
- Use `go fmt` for consistent formatting
- Use `go vet` for static analysis

### Documentation
- Document exported functions and types
- Use clear, concise comments
- Include examples for complex functions
- Keep documen
