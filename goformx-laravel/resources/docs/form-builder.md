# Form Builder

The form builder uses a drag-and-drop interface to create forms visually.

## Adding fields

The left sidebar contains field groups:

- **Basic** — text field, text area, number, password, checkbox, select, radio
- **Advanced** — email, URL, phone number, date/time, file upload, signature
- **Layout** — columns, panel, tabs, well, fieldset

Drag any field onto the canvas to add it to your form.

## Editing fields

Click any field on the canvas to open the edit dialog. You can configure:

- **Label** — the field's display name
- **Placeholder** — hint text shown when empty
- **Required** — whether the field must be filled
- **Validation** — min/max length, pattern, custom error messages
- **Conditional** — show/hide based on other field values

## Reordering fields

Drag fields up or down on the canvas to reorder them.

## Previewing

Click **Preview** in the toolbar to see how your form looks to users. This opens a read-only view of the form.

## Saving

Click **Save** to persist your changes. The form schema is stored and used when rendering the public form and processing submissions.
