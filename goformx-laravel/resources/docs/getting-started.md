# Getting Started

GoFormX is a forms platform that lets you build, embed, and collect submissions — no backend code required.

## Create an account

1. Click **Register** in the top-right corner
2. Enter your name, email, and password
3. Verify your email address

## Build your first form

1. From the **Dashboard**, click **Forms** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Form**
3. Give your form a name and click **Create**
4. You'll land in the **Form Builder** — drag fields from the left sidebar onto the canvas
5. Click **Save** when you're done

## Share your form

Every form gets a public URL you can share directly:

```
https://goformx.com/forms/{form-id}
```

Or embed it in your own site — see [Embedding Forms](/docs/embedding-forms).

## View submissions

When someone fills out your form, submissions appear under **Forms → [Your Form] → Submissions**. See [Submissions](/docs/submissions) for details.
